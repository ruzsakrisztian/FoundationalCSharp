Foundational C# with Microsoft (followed by freeCodeCamp certification exam).

This repository contains my learning path of the free "Foundational C#" course on freeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/).

The code is very similar to the one on Microsoft Learn, but I usually made small experiments through the course.
